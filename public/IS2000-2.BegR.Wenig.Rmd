## Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

## Question 1

```{r Q1_loadCSV}

#reads csv from URL 
url <- "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/artificium.us/datasets/FlightsWithAirlines.csv"
df.flights <- read.csv(url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Question 2

```{r Q2_str}
#checks the structure of the df 
str(df.flights)
```

## Question 3

```{r Q3_head4rows}
#displays the first 4 rows of the df 
head(df.flights, 4)
```

## Question 4

```{r Q5_tail5rows}
#displays the last 5 rows of the df 
tail(df.flights, 5)
```

## Question 5

```{r Q5_displayselectcolumns}
#display only the carrier, flight, origin, and destination
print(df.flights[, c('carrier', 'flight', 'origin', 'dest')])

```

## Question 6

```{r Q6_averageDepartureDelay}
#Calculate the average (mean) and displays the result 
m = mean(df.flights$dep_delay)
cat(paste0("Average departure delay = ", m))

```

## Question 7

```{r Q7_newColumnTod}
# add column to df.flights
df.flights$tod <- ifelse(df.flights$dep_hr < 12 | df.flights$dep_hr == 24, "am", "pm")

# checks to see if the column was added 
print(df.flights)

```



## Question 8

```{r Q8_displaySelectColumns2}



#adds the delay and minutes together 
df.flights$totalMinutes <- df.flights$dep_min + df.flights$dep_delay

#finds the minutes remaining after calculating the carryover 
df.flights$newMinutes <- df.flights$totalMinutes %% 60

#creates the minutes that are single digits with a leading zero 
df.flights$formattedMinutes <- ifelse(df.flights$newMinutes < 10, paste0("0", df.flights$newMinutes), df.flights$newMinutes)


#calculates how many hours to add 
df.flights$newHour <- ifelse(df.flights$totalMinutes > 60, df.flights$dep_hr + floor(df.flights$totalMinutes / 60), df.flights$dep_hr)


#creates the time in HH:MM format 
df.flights$actualDepartureTime <- paste(df.flights$newHour, df.flights$formattedMinutes, sep= ":")


#displays the info 
print(df.flights[,c('carrier', 'flight', 'actualDepartureTime')])

```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
